LSP For my LSP I am using the built in neovim lsp and williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer to install them. For Clojure I am using clojure-lsp.

I was amazed by all the functional tools at my disposal and by the way they fit together. This started my journey on the path of learning more about functional programming.
After I had my fair share of fun with Haskell I quickly jumped to Erlang which was a programming language quite different from anything I had seen up until then.</description></item></channel></rss>
