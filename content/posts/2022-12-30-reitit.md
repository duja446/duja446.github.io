# Reitit

Reitit is a routing library that can provides fast and extensible routing on top of Ring. To use it 
we need to include it in the Ring application handler and provide it with a vector of routes.
```clojure
(ns ring-demo.core
  (:require [reitit.ring :as reitit]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]))

(def routes 
  [["/" {:get get-handler}]])

(def handler
  (reitit/ring-handler
    (reitit/router routes)))

(defn -main 
  []
  (jetty/run-jetty
    handler
    {:port 3000
     :join? false}))
```

Each routes is declared using a vector where the first element is a string representing the route path, 
and the second element is a map which contains an operation and a function which handles this request.

Reitit also supports dynamic paths with embedded parameters.
```clojure
(def routes
  [["/echo/:id"
    {:get 
      (fn [{{:keys [id]} :path-params}]
        (response/ok (str "<p>id: " id "</p>")))}]])
```

## Defaults

The second parameter of `reitit/ring-handler` is a optional default handler. We can create it using 
`reitit/create-default-handler`.
```clojure
(def handler
  (reitit/ring-handler
    (reitit/router routes)
    (reitit/create-default-handler
      {:not-found 
        (constantly (response/not-found "404 - Page not found"))
       :method-not-allowed
        (constantly (response/method-not-allowed "405 - Not allowed"))})))
```

Reitit also provides `create-resource-handler` for serving static resources. 
```clojure
(def handler
  (reitit/ring-handler
    (reitit/router routes)
    (reitit/create-resource-handler {:path "/"})))
```
