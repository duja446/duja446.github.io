The reason for this is that Clojure is a Lisp, a variant of the Lisp programming language.
Forms Clojure recognizes two kinds of structures:
literal representations of data structures (numbers, strings &amp;hellip;) operations Term form refers to an expression in Clojure.

LSP For my LSP I am using the built in neovim lsp and williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer to install them. For Clojure I am using clojure-lsp.

I was amazed by all the functional tools at my disposal and by the way they fit together. This started my journey on the path of learning more about functional programming.
After I had my fair share of fun with Haskell I quickly jumped to Erlang which was a programming language quite different from anything I had seen up until then.</description></item></channel></rss>
